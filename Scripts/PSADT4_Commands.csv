"ID","CommandName","Description"
"1","Add-ADTEdgeExtension","This function adds an extension for Microsoft Edge using the ExtensionSettings policy: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-manage-extensions-ref-guide. This enables Edge Extensions to be installed and managed like applications, enabling extensions to be pushed to specific devices or users alongside existing GPO/Intune extension policies. This should not be used in conjunction with Edge Management Service which leverages the same registry key to configure Edge extensions."
"2","Add-ADTModuleCallback","This function adds a specified callback function to the nominated hooking point."
"3","Block-ADTAppExecution","This function is called when you pass the -BlockExecution parameter to the Stop-RunningApplications function. It does the following: 1) Makes a copy of this script in a temporary directory on the local machine. 2) Checks for an existing scheduled task from previous failed installation attempt where apps were blocked and if found, calls the Unblock-ADTAppExecution function to restore the original IFEO registry keys. This is to prevent the function from overriding the backup of the original IFEO options. 3) Creates a scheduled task to restore the IFEO registry key values in case the script is terminated uncleanly by calling `Unblock-ADTAppExecution` the local temporary copy of this module. 4) Modifies the ""Image File Execution Options"" registry key for the specified process(s) to call `Show-ADTInstallationPrompt` with the appropriate messaging via this module. 5) When the script is called with those parameters, it will display a custom message to the user to indicate that execution of the application has been blocked while the installation is in progress. The text of this message can be customized in the strings.psd1 file."
