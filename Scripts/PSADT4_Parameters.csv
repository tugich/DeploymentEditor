The word ""Shell"" in this context refers to a graphical shell (similar to the Windows shell) rather than command shells (for example, bash or sh) and lets users launch   graphical applications or open documents. It lets you open a file or a url and the Shell will figure out the program to open it with.    The WorkingDirectory property behaves differently depending on the value of the UseShellExecute property. When UseShellExecute is true, the WorkingDirectory property   specifies the location of the executable. When UseShellExecute is false, the WorkingDirectory property is not used to find the executable. Instead, it is used only by the   process that is started and has meaning only within the context of the new process.
