Visual Software Packaging Editor by TUGI.CH

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## üßë‚Äçüíª About The Project
**Welcome to the Deployment Editor for PSADT (PSAppDeployToolkit).** This application simplifies the packaging process for all Windows engineers. You can click your sequence for PSADT through the GUI and with just one simple click you get the fully automated coded PowerShell script for the deployment. The best part: It‚Äôs free & open-source.<br/><br/>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## ‚úÖ Getting Started

### Requirements
Windows 10/11 64-bit (It also runs well on ARM-based Windows via the translation layer.)<br/>
PureBasic IDE (to compile the source code if needed, binary is included in each release).

### Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites for this tool. All required files are included in this GitHub repository.

### Installation
You can download the latest release from GitHub or use the MSI installer from the releases.<br/>
The editor runs in user context and doesn't require administrator rights. For packaging, you need administrator rights to run a packaging project (in system context).

<!-- TEMPLATE SYSTEM -->
## ‚úÖ (v1.0.7) Project-based templates
There are several templates for each part of the editor. You can customize them and the compiler will take them for each time in the deployment file generation process.
In the latest version (v1.0.7), each project/PSADT package contains its own template (Invoke-AppDeployToolkit.ps1.template) for the final resulting file (Invoke-AppDeployToolkit.ps1).
